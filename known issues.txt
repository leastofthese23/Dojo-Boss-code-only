KNOWN ISSUES:

This app has mild to moderate issues, all of which may or may not be addressed depending on how the application develops and
user feedback. It is important to keep in mind that a new application is being developed to run independantly from MS Access
and Google Backup & Sync, so the current App will be phased out.

- Most of the variables in the modules are declared at the beginning of the module, making the variables accessable throughout 
  the module. Most of the functions do not take paramaters, but instead work with the variables that are accessable throughout
  the module. This is not so much of a security issue because MS Access and vba are low in security by nature, but it may
  impact performance due to keeping variables in memory longer than necessary. Functions accepting parameters could also 
  improve code readability.
  
- There is probably some junk code in certain modules that is no longer being used. Some was commented out and left intentionally
  in case of desire to implement at a later time.
  
- There is no a lot of commenting on what functions do to give an overview of functions.

- Application is a little slow to load up initially.
